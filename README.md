# Encounter - README
a simple encounter-engine in java

## Intention
This is supposed to be a small pet project for me personally with a variety of uses.

1. Have a pet project.
	+ Which means having something to build on,
	+ improves with my skills in development
	+ and helps me exercise and improve my development skills in return.
2. Have an easily integrated engine for my labs.
	+ Meaning an easy to use backend for any app gui I am going to learn.

Therefore, Encounter is supposed to be a lean, well written engine that will give you objects to play with.

## Concept
The idea is to have an hero object with some stats that can engage with encounters and resolve them.

There are planned to be three kinds of encounter:

1. Fighting (monsters)
2. Talking (with people)
3. Using (items, traps or the like)

I don't expect to put much work into this, but in the long shot I'd like to see mods and expansions to this basic idea, like environment, quests and unlockable content (new places, new encounters, for instance).
